# ServoExperiments
A place for servo code. 

This repository contains all experiments with servos by [Alf Andersen](https://github.com/orgs/ArT-Programming/people/alfandersen) and [Nikolaj Andersson](https://github.com/NikolajAndersson), 2016.

There is a NAservo library, and a NAservoChip library for servo control. See source files for documentation. The [CD4017BE](http://www.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/pdf/26857/TI/CD4017BE.html) allows you to control 20 servo with one Arduino Uno. UNLIMITED POWER!!!
